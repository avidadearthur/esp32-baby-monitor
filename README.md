## Git Workflow
To make sure we don't loose code and can get the most out of the version control tools form GitLab let's try to follow the following gidelines:

1. Watch videos about git on toledo.
2. Always work under dev/your_username_branch. When you've got the code you are working on functoning create a pull request and we can add to the dev/ branch.
3. The master branch should only contain code that works, let's keep it like that.
4. Commit your code often and with meaningful commits. If something goes wrong you can go back to your previous commits.
5. Sugestions ... ?

## About The Project
There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited our needs. Let's leave this like that for now and later add more info regarding the software side of this project.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. 

As soon as we have code written here we can document it better.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://gitlab.groept.be/ib3/a22-baby2.git
   ```
