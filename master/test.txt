how to use:
1. digitzied signal from ADC output is send to fast fourier transform, whcih is done in fftPeak.c
    signal SAMPLES size (N) in fftPeak.c fft in each frame is 1024, default SAMPLING_RATE is 16,000;
    fftw library is used to achieve faster speed and lower power consumption
    with frequency spectrum calculated in fft, peaks can be found absed on power comparison and are saved into freuqency array
    frequency array contains the f0 and its harmonics
2. vowels and consonants can be distinguish in a cepstrum domain, yet as phonectics recognition is not the main goal for the project,
    we implement a simplied version that only counts the occurance of consonants to avoid false cry detection triggered by closely related vowels

3. to be optimized: 
    Overlap-save fft w/ zero-padded FIR filter implementation
    check the aperture time and sampling rate is safe
4. implement the cry identification algorithm
    by using the same logic demonstrated in labview: identifying the pitch, number of peaks, and the range
5. integrate ZCR and STE into the algorithm as relative parameter features
